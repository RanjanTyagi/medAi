# Current Application Status

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Navigation & Authentication
- **Home Page** (http://localhost:3000) - Landing page with features
- **Login** (http://localhost:3000/auth/login) - User authentication
- **Register** (http://localhost:3000/auth/register) - New user registration
- **Logout** - Available in the top navigation bar (click "Sign out")

### 2. User Roles
The application supports three user roles:
- **Patient** - Can submit symptoms and view reports
- **Doctor** - Can verify reports and add notes
- **Admin** - Can manage users and view system analytics

### 3. Automatic Routing
When you visit http://localhost:3000:
- If **not logged in** → Shows landing page
- If **logged in as Patient** → Redirects to `/patient/dashboard`
- If **logged in as Doctor** → Redirects to `/doctor/dashboard`
- If **logged in as Admin** → Redirects to `/admin/dashboard`

This is why you're seeing the admin dashboard - you're currently logged in as an admin user!

## 🔄 Current Limitations

### Mock Data in Dashboards
The dashboards currently show **mock/dummy data** because:

1. **No Real Users Yet** - You need to create test users first
2. **No Real Reports** - No patients have submitted symptoms yet
3. **Database Not Populated** - The database tables are empty

### Why Mock Data?
Mock data allows you to:
- See the UI layout and design
- Test navigation and features
- Understand the workflow
- Verify the interface works correctly

## 🚀 How to Get Real Data

### Step 1: Create Test Users

Run this command to create test accounts:
```bash
npm run test:setup
```

This creates:
- 2 Patient accounts
- 2 Doctor accounts  
- 1 Admin account

### Step 2: Test the Patient Workflow

1. **Logout** (click "Sign out" in top right)
2. **Login as Patient**
   - Email: `patient1@test.com`
   - Password: `TestPatient123!`
3. **Submit Symptoms**
   - Go to patient dashboard
   - Click "New Diagnosis" or similar
   - Enter symptoms
   - Upload medical image (optional)
   - Submit
4. **View AI Diagnosis**
   - See the AI-generated report
   - Report status will be "pending"

### Step 3: Test the Doctor Workflow

1. **Logout**
2. **Login as Doctor**
   - Email: `doctor1@test.com`
   - Password: `TestDoctor123!`
3. **Verify Reports**
   - See pending reports in queue
   - Review AI analysis
   - Add doctor notes
   - Verify or reject report

### Step 4: Test the Admin Workflow

1. **Logout**
2. **Login as Admin**
   - Email: `admin@test.com`
   - Password: `TestAdmin123!`
3. **View Real Data**
   - User management
   - System analytics
   - Report statistics
   - Audit logs

## 📍 Navigation Guide

- New Report → `/patient/new-report`
- My Reports → `/patient/reports`

### Doctor Routes

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### "I only see the admin dashboard"
**Solution:** You're logged in as admin. To see other pages:
1. Click "Sign out" (top right)
2. You'll be redirected to the home page
3. From there you can login as different roles or browse the landing page

### "Where is the logout button?"
**Location:** Top right corner of the page
- Desktop: Shows "Sign out" button next to your name
- Mobile: Click the menu icon (☰) then "Sign out"

### "I want to see the landing page"
**Solution:** 
1. Logout if you're logged in
2. Visit http://localhost:3000
3. You'll see the full landing page with features

### "The data looks fake"
**Explanation:** Yes, it's mock data! Follow the steps above to create real test data.

## 📊 Understanding the Mock Data

The admin dashboard shows:
- **150 Total Users** (mock)
- **89 Total Reports** (mock)
- **System Health: Healthy** (mock)

These numbers are placeholders to show you:
- How the dashboard will look with real data
- The layout and design
- What metrics will be tracked

Once you create test users and submit real reports, you'll see actual data!

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Logout** to see the home page
2. **Create test users** with `npm run test:setup`
3. **Test each role** by logging in with different accounts
4. **Submit real symptoms** as a patient
5. **Verify reports** as a doctor
6. **View real analytics** as an admin

## 💡 Tips

- **Always logout** before switching roles
- **Use the navigation menu** at the top to move between pages
- **Check your role badge** to see which account you're using
- **Test the full workflow** from patient → doctor → admin
