http://localhost:3000/auth/login
```

### 2. Test Patient Flow

# After logging in as patient:
1. Visit /patient/dashboard
2. Click "New Diagnosis"
3. Fill in symptoms
4. Upload an image (optional)
5. Submit

/doctor
/admin
/auth
/patient/diagnose
/doctor/reports/[any-id]
/admin/users
/admin/audit-logs
/some-invalid-route  # Should show 404 page
```

## All TypeScript Errors Fixed
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All components properly typed
- ✅ All imports resolved
- ✅ All props correctly passed

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All pages are now functional. No more 404 errors. The application is ready for end-to-end testing.

## Important Notes

1. **Database Setup Required**
   - Ensure all Supabase migrations are run
   - Verify `.env.local` has correct credentials
   - Check that database tables exist

2. **Authentication Required**
   - Most pages require login
   - Create test accounts for each role
   - Use debug page (`/debug/auth`) to verify auth status

3. **File Upload**
   - Supabase storage must be configured
   - Storage policies must be set up
   - Check file size limits (10MB default)

4. **AI Integration**
   - Google Gemini API key must be set
   - API calls will fail without valid key
   - Check `.env.local` for `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
