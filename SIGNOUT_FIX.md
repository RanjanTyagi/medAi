# Sign Out Button Fix

## Problem
The "Sign out" button in the navbar was not working properly.

## Root Cause
The sign out functionality had potential issues:
1. Errors were being silently caught without user feedback
2. Local state wasn't being cleared if Supabase API call failed
3. Router navigation might not fully clear the session state

## Solution

### 1. Improved Navbar Sign Out Handler (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Changed from `router.push('/')` to `window.location.href = '/'` for hard redirect
- Added user-friendly error alert
- Better error logging to console

**Why Hard Redirect?**
- `window.location.href` forces a full page reload
- Clears all React state and context
- Ensures clean session termination
- More reliable than Next.js router for auth changes

### 2. Enhanced Auth Context Sign Out (`src/lib/auth-context.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added try-catch block for better error handling
- Clear local state (`setUser(null)`, `setSession(null)`) immediately
- Clear state even if Supabase API call fails
- Better error logging

**Why Clear State Regardless?**
- User should be logged out locally even if API fails
- Prevents stuck "logged in" state
- Improves user experience

## How It Works Now

### Sign Out Flow:
1. **User clicks "Sign out"** → `handleSignOut()` called
2. **Log initiation** → Track sign out attempt
3. **Call Supabase** → `supabase.auth.signOut()`
4. **Clear local state** → Remove user and session from context
5. **Hard redirect** → `window.location.href = '/'`
6. **Page reloads** → Fresh state, no cached data

### Error Handling:
- If Supabase fails → Still clear local state
- Show alert to user → "Failed to sign out. Please try again."
- Log error to console → For debugging
- User can try again → Button remains functional

## Testing

### Test Sign Out:
1. Log in to the application
2. Click "Sign out" button in navbar
3. Should see:
   - Page redirects to home page
   - User is logged out
   - No errors in console
   - Can log in again successfully

### Test Error Handling:
1. Disconnect internet
2. Click "Sign out"
3. Should see:
   - Alert message about failure
   - Still logged out locally
   - Can reconnect and continue

## Benefits

✅ **Reliable**: Works even if API fails
✅ **User-friendly**: Shows error messages
✅ **Clean state**: Hard redirect clears everything
✅ **Debuggable**: Detailed logging
✅ **Secure**: Ensures user is logged out
